How to Get a Free Domain Name for Your Website

If you want to create a website, you need a domain name. A domain name is the address of your website on the internet, such as www.example.com. It helps people find your site and remember your brand.

But how do you get a domain name for free? Is it even possible?

The answer is yes, but there are some limitations and trade-offs. In this blog post, I will explain how to get a free domain name and what are the pros and cons of doing so.

There are two main ways to get a free domain name:

1. Get a free domain name with a web hosting plan
2. Get a free domain name with a website builder plan

Let's look at each option in more detail.

## Get a free domain name with a web hosting plan

One of the easiest ways to get a free domain name is to sign up for a web hosting plan that offers a free domain name registration as part of the package.

Web hosting is the service that provides the space and resources for your website to run online. You need web hosting to store your website files and make them accessible to visitors.

Many web hosting providers offer a free domain name for one year when you purchase one of their plans. For example, Hostinger offers a free domain name with its Premium and Business shared hosting, WordPress hosting, and Cloud hosting plans¹. IONOS also offers a free domain name with its web hosting and MyWebsite plans².

The benefits of getting a free domain name with a web hosting plan are:

- You can save money on domain registration fees
- You can get a professional domain name with popular extensions like .com, .net, .org, .biz, .me, .online, etc.
- You can manage your domain name and web hosting from the same provider
- You can get additional features like domain privacy protection, SSL certificate, email accounts, etc.

The drawbacks of getting a free domain name with a web hosting plan are:

- You have to pay for web hosting, which may be more expensive than just buying a domain name
- You may lose your free domain name if you cancel your web hosting plan or switch to another provider
- You may have limited options for transferring your domain name to another registrar

## Get a free domain name with a website builder plan

Another way to get a free domain name is to sign up for a website builder plan that offers a free domain name as part of the package.

A website builder is an online tool that allows you to create a website without coding. You can choose from hundreds of templates, customize them with drag and drop elements, and publish your site in minutes.

Many website builders offer a free domain name for one year when you purchase one of their plans. For example, Wix offers a free domain name with its Combo and higher plans. Squarespace offers a free domain name with its Personal and higher plans.

The benefits of getting a free domain name with a website builder plan are:

- You can create a website easily and quickly without coding
- You can get a professional domain name with popular extensions like .com, .net, .org, .biz, .me, .online, etc.
- You can manage your domain name and website from the same provider
- You can get additional features like SSL certificate, email accounts, SEO tools, etc.

The drawbacks of getting a free domain name with a website builder plan are:

- You have to pay for website builder, which may be more expensive than just buying a domain name
- You may lose your free domain name if you cancel your website builder plan or switch to another provider
- You may have limited options for transferring your domain name to another registrar

## Get a free domain name with Freenom

There is one more option to get a free domain name: Freenom.

Freenom is a company that offers free domains with extensions like .tk, .ml, .ga, .cf, and .gq⁴. These are country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) that belong to small or developing countries.

The benefits of getting a free domain name with Freenom are:

- You don't have to pay anything for the domain registration
- You can use any web hosting or website builder service you want
- You can transfer your domain name to another registrar at any time

The drawbacks of getting a free domain name with Freenom are:
